# Problem
Shuster (1991) describes a number of probability calculations that he did for a court case involving the sale of cocaine. A Florida police department seized 496 suspected packets of cocaine, of which four were randomly selected and tested and found to actually be cocaine. The police then chose two more packets at random and, posing as drug dealers, sold the packets to the defendant. These last two packets were lost before they could be tested to verify that they were, indeed, cocaine.

(a) If the original 496 packets were composed of $N$ packets of cocaine and $M = 496 - N$ noncocaine, show that the probability of selecting 4 cocaine packets and then 2 noncocaine packets, which is the probability that the defendant is innocent of buying cocaine, is

$$
\frac{
\binom{N}{4} \binom{M}{2}
}{
\binom{N+M}{4} \binom{N+M-4}{2}
}
$$

(b) Maximizing (in $M$ and $N$) the probability in part (a) maximizes the defendant's "innocence probability". Show that this probability is 0.022, attained at $M = 165$ and $N = 331$.

# Solution
## (a)
Selecting 4 Cocaine packets picking cocaine packet has this probability:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{N}{N + M} \frac{N-1}{N + M - 1}  \frac{N-2}{N + M-2} \frac{N-3}{N + M-3} &=  \frac{N!}{(N - 4)!} \frac{1}{\frac{(N + M)!}{(N + M - 4)!}} \\
&= \frac{4!}{4!}\frac{N!}{(N - 4)!} \frac{1}{\frac{(N + M)!}{(N + M - 4)!}} \\
&= 4!\binom{N}{4} \left(\frac{(N + M)!}{(N + M - 4)!}\right)^{-1}.
\end{aligned}
$$
Selecting 2 Not-Cocaine packets out of the remaining ones can be computed as
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{M}{N + M - 4} \frac{M - 1}{N + M - 5} &= \frac{M!}{(M - 2)!} \frac{1}{\frac{(N + M - 4)!}{(N + M - 6)!}} \\
&= \frac{2!}{2!}\frac{M!}{(M - 2)!} \frac{1}{\frac{(N + M - 4)!}{(N + M - 6)!}} \\
&= 2! \binom{M}{2} \left( \frac{(N + M - 4)!}{(N + M - 6)!} \right)^{-1}.
\end{aligned}
$$
Note that
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{(N + M)!}{(N + M - 4)!} \cdot \frac{(N + M - 4)!}{(N + M - 6)!} &= (4!) (2!) \frac{(N + M)!}{(N + M - 4)! 4!} \cdot \frac{(N + M - 4)!}{(N + M - 6)!2!} \\
&= (4!)(2!) \binom{N + M}{4} \binom{N + M - 4}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$
As such in total we have
$$
\frac{
\binom{N}{4} \binom{M}{2}
}{
\binom{N+M}{4} \binom{N+M-4}{2}
}.
$$
## (b)
We can rewrite the value as such:
$$
\frac{N!M!(N + M - 6)!}{(N - 4)!(M - 2)!(N + M)!}
$$
Note that every term here is positive and $N + M - 6 = 490, N + M = 496$ are constants as such we can leave it out. With that we want to maximize
$$
\frac{N! M!}{(N - 4)! (M - 2)!} = \frac{N!(496 - N)!}{(N - 4)!(496 - N - 2)}
$$
This can be computed first by notingthe following:
$$
\frac{N!}{(N - 4)!} = N (N - 1) (N - 2) (N - 3)
$$
$$
\frac{(496 - N)!}{(496 - N - 2)!} = (496 - N)(496 - N - 1) = (496 - N)(495 - N)
$$
Define
$$
g(x) = x(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(496 - x)(495 - x),
$$
we are interested in values $x \geq 1$ such that $g'(x) = 0$. Because we have at least 4 cocaine packets we can restrict our view to $x \geq 4$.

The derivative is
$$
g'(x) = -1473120 + 5413332 x - 4452081 x^2 + 1005908 x^3 - 4985 x^4 + 6 x^5
$$
and $g'(x) = 0$ for $x \geq 4$ for approximately the following values:
$$
330.834, 495.501
$$

Taking the second derivative we get
$$
g''(x) = 5413332 - 8904162 x + 3017724 x^2 - 19940 x^3 + 30 x^4
$$
and plugging in the extremal values yields
$$
g''(330.834) < 0, g''(495.501) > 0.
$$
As such our candidates are $M = 330$ and $M = 331$.
$$
\begin{aligned}
g(330) = 318950631568800,&&g(331) = 318962383185600
\end{aligned}
$$
We can see that $g(331) > g(330)$ as such $N = 331, N = 165$ is indeed our maximum. To get the probability we can simply include the constant terms to obtain
$$
g(331) \frac{490!}{496!} = \frac{g(331)}{496 \cdot 495 \cdot 494 \cdot 493 \cdot 492 \cdot 491} \approx 2.2\%.
$$
