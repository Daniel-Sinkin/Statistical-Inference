# Problem
Let $X_1, \dots, X_n$ be iid random variables with continuous cdf $F_X$, and suppose $E X_i = \mu$. Define the random variables $Y_1, \dots, Y_n$ by

$$
Y_i =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } X_i > \mu \\
0 & \text{if } X_i \leq \mu
\end{cases}
$$

Find the distribution of $\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i$.

# Solution
Define $Y := \sum_i Y_i$ and note that $0 \leq Y \leq n$, we will only consider values in that range.

By definition of a CDF we know $P(X_i \leq \mu) = F_X(E[X_i]) = F_X(\mu)$ we write $p := 1 - F_X(\mu)$.

For $Y = k$ to hold we need exactly $k$ hits (probability $p$) and $n - k$ misses (probability $1 - p$), this is exactly the Binomial distribution, as such
$$
Y \sim \operatorname{Bin}(n, p),
$$
i.e. the pmf of $Y$ is
$$
P(Y = k) = \binom{n}{k} (1 - F_X(\mu))^kF_X(\mu)^{n - k}.
$$
