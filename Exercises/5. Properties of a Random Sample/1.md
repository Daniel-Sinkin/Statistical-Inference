# Problem
Color blindness appears in 1% of the people in a certain population. How large must a sample be if the probability of its containing a color-blind person is to be .95 or more? (Assume that the population is large enough to be considered infinite, so that sampling can be considered to be with replacement.)

Let (X_1, \dots, X_N) be samples with $X_i$ being $1$ if the person is blind and $0$ otherwise. Define $Y := \sum_{i = 1}^N X_i$, we are interested in finding N such that
$$
P(Y \geq 1) \geq 0.95
$$
or equivalently (because $Y \geq 0$)
$$
1 - P(Y = 0) \geq 0.95 \iff 0.05 \geq P(Y = 0).
$$

Note that
$$
P(Y = 0) = P(X_1 = 0, \dots, X_N = 0) \overset{\text{independence}}{=} P(X_1 = 0)^N = 0.99^N
$$
with that the equation becomes
$$
0.05 \geq 0.99^N
$$
which is the case for $N \geq 299$.
