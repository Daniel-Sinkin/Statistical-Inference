### Exercise 5.7
In Example 5.2.10, a partial fraction decomposition is needed to derive the distribution of the sum of two independent Cauchy random variables. This exercise provides the details that are skipped in that example.

(a) Find the constants $A, B, C,$ and $D$ that satisfy:

$$
\frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{w}{\sigma} \right)^2} + \frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{z - w}{\tau} \right)^2} = \frac{A w}{1 + \left( \frac{w}{\sigma} \right)^2} + \frac{B}{1 + \left( \frac{w}{\sigma} \right)^2} - \frac{C w}{1 + \left( \frac{(z - w)}{\tau} \right)^2} - \frac{D}{1 + \left( \frac{(z - w)}{\tau} \right)^2}
$$

where $A, B, C, D$ may depend on $z$ but not on $w$.

(b) Using the facts that

$$
\int \frac{t}{1 + t^2} dt = \frac{1}{2} \log(1 + t^2) + \text{constant}
$$

and

$$
\int \frac{1}{1 + t^2} dt = \arctan(t) + \text{constant},
$$

evaluate (5.2.4) and hence verify (5.2.5).

(Note that the integration in part (b) is quite delicate. Since the mean of a Cauchy does not exist, the integrals
$$
\int_{- \infty}^\infty \frac{Aw}{1 + (w / \sigma)^2} dw
$$
and
$$
\int_{- \infty}^\infty \frac{Cw}{1 + ((z - w)) / \tau)^2} dw
$$
do not exist. However, the integral of the difference _does exist_, which is all that is needed.)
