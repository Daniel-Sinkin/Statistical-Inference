### Exercise 5.10
Let $X_1, \dots, X_n$ be a random sample from a $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ population.

(a) Find expressions for $\theta_1, \dots, \theta_4$, as defined in Exercise 5.8, in terms of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$.

(b) Use the results of Exercise 5.8, together with the results of part (a), to calculate $\text{Var}(S^2)$.

(c) Show that $1 / S^2 / \sigma^2$ has a completely different (and easier) way. Use the fact that

$$
(n - 1) S^2 / \sigma^2 \sim \chi_{n-1}^2.
$$
