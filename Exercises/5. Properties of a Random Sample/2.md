### 5.2
Suppose $X_1, X_2, \dots$ are jointly continuous and independent, each distributed with marginal pdf $f(x)$, where each $X_i$ represents annual rainfall at a given location.

(a) Find the distribution of the number of years until the first year's rainfall, $X_1$, is exceeded for the first time.

(b) Show that the mean number of years until $X_1$ is exceeded for the first time is infinite.
