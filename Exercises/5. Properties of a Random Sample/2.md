# Problem
Suppose $X_1, X_2, \dots$ are jointly continuous and independent, each distributed with marginal pdf $f(x)$, where each $X_i$ represents annual rainfall at a given location.

(a) Find the distribution of the number of years until the first year's rainfall, $X_1$, is exceeded for the first time.

(b) Show that the mean number of years until $X_1$ is exceeded for the first time is infinite.

# Solution
## (a)
Fix $X_1 = x$ then $P(X_j > X_1) = 1 - P(X_j \leq X_1)$ which by definition of the CDF $F$ of $f$ is equal to $1 - F(X_1)$.

Define a new random variable $Y$ by $Y = k$ if we exceed $X_1$ in the $(k + 1).$ year for the first time, i.e.
$$
Y = k \iff X_1 \geq \max\{X_2, \dots,X_k\}, X_1 < X_{k + 1}.
$$

We are interested in the distribution of $Y | X = x$. For that we note that because the $(X_j)_j$ are iid the probability of $X_j \leq x$ is exactly $p := 1-F(x).$

As such
$$
P(Y = k | X_1 = x) = (1 - p)^{k-1}p = F(x)^{k - 1}(1 - F(x)),
$$
based on this we can get the unconditional distribution:
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(Y = k) &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty P(Y = k | X_1 = x)f(x) dx \\
&= \int_{-\infty}^\infty F(x)^{k - 1}(1 - F(x))f(x)dx
\end{aligned}
$$
Note that because $F'(x) = f(x)$ we can write $u = F(x), F(\infty) = 0, F(\infty) = 1$ and $du = F'(x) dx = f(x) dx$ so that our expression reduces to
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(Y = k) &= \int_0^1 u^k(1 - u) du \\
&= \int_0^1 u^kdu - \int_0^1 u^{k + 1}du \\
&= \frac{1}{k^2 + 3k + 2}.
\end{aligned}
$$

## (b)
$$
\begin{aligned}
E[Y] &= \sum_{k = 0}^\infty kP(Y = k) \\
&= \sum_{k = 0}^\infty \frac{k}{k^2 + 3k + 2} \\
&= \sum_{k = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{k + 3 + 2 / k} \\
\end{aligned}
$$
diverges as a type of harmonic series.
