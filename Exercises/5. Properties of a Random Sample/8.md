### Exercise 5.8
Let $X_1, \dots, X_n$ be a random sample, where $\overline{X}$ and $S^2$ are calculated in the usual way.

(a) Show that

$$
S^2 = \frac{1}{2n(n - 1)} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - X_j)^2.
$$

Assume now that the $X_i$'s have a finite fourth moment, and denote $\theta_1 = E(X_i), \theta_2 = E(X_i - \theta_1)^2$.

(b) Show that 
$$
\text{Var}(S^2) = \frac{1}{n} \left( \theta_4 - \frac{n-3}{n-1} \theta_2^2 \right).
$$

(c) Find $\text{Cov}(\overline{X}, S^2)$ in terms of $\theta_1, \dots, \theta_4$. Under what conditions is $\text{Cov}(\overline{X}, S^2) = 0$?
