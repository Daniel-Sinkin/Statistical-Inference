A generalization of iid random variables is **exchangeable** random variables, an idea due to deFinetti (1972). A discussion of exchangeability can also be found in Feller (1971). The random variables $X_1, \dots, X_n$ are **exchangeable** if any permutation of any subset of them of size $k$ $(k \leq n)$ has the same distribution. In this exercise we will see an example of random variables that are exchangeable but not iid. Let $X_i | P \sim$ iid Bernoulli$(P), i = 1, \dots, n$, and let $P \sim$ uniform$(0,1)$.

(a) Show that the marginal distribution of any $k$ of the $X$s is the same as

$$
P(X_1 = x_1, \dots, X_k = x_k) = \int_0^1 p^{t} (1-p)^{k-t} dp = \frac{t! (k-t)!}{(k+1)!},
$$

where $t = \sum_{i=1}^{k} x_i$. Hence, the $X$s are exchangeable.

(b) Show that, marginally,

$$
P(X_1 = x_1, \dots, X_n = x_n) \neq \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(X_i = x_i),
$$

so the distribution of the $X$s is exchangeable but not iid.

(deFinetti proved an elegant characterization theorem for an infinite sequence of exchangeable random variables. He proved that any such sequence of exchangeable random variables is a mixture of idd random variables.)
