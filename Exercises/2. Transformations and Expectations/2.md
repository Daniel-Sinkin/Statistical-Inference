# Problem
In each of the following, find the pdf of $Y$.

(a) $Y = X^2$ and $f_X(x) = 1, \ 0 < x < 1$

(b) $Y = -\log X$ and $X$ has pdf

$$
f_X(x) = \frac{(n+m+1)!}{n! m!} x^n (1 - x)^m, \ 0 < x < 1, \ m, n \ \text{positive integers}
$$

(c) $Y = e^X$ and $X$ has pdf

$$
f_X(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma^2} x e^{-(x/\sigma)^2/2}, \ 0 < x < \infty, \ \sigma^2 \ \text{a positive constant}
$$

# Solution
## (a)
$g(x) = x^2 \implies g^{-1}(y) = y^{1/2} \implies \frac{d}{dy} g^{-1}(y) = \frac{1}{2}y^{-1/2}$.

As such
$$
f_Y(y) = \underbrace{f_X(y^{1/2})}_{= 1} \frac{1}{2} y^{- 1/2} = \frac{1}{2} y^{-1/2}.
$$

## (b)
