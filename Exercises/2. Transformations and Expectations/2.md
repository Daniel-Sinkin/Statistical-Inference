### 2.2
In each of the following, find the pdf of $Y$.

(a) $Y = X^2$ and $f_X(x) = 1, \ 0 < x < 1$

(b) $Y = -\log X$ and $X$ has pdf

$$
f_X(x) = \frac{(n+m+1)!}{n! m!} x^n (1 - x)^m, \ 0 < x < 1, \ m, n \ \text{positive integers}
$$

(c) $Y = e^X$ and $X$ has pdf

$$
f_X(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma^2} x e^{-(x/\sigma)^2/2}, \ 0 < x < \infty, \ \sigma^2 \ \text{a positive constant}
$$
