### 2.7
Let $X$ have pdf $f_X(x) = \frac{3}{2}(x + 1), \ -1 \leq x \leq 2$.

(a) Find the pdf of $Y = X^2$. Note that Theorem 2.1.8 is not directly applicable in this problem.

(b) Show that Theorem 2.1.8 remains valid if the sets $A_0, A_1, \dots, A_k$ contain $X$, and apply the extension to solve part (a) using $A_0 = \emptyset, A_1 = (-1, 1), A_2 = (1, 2)$.
