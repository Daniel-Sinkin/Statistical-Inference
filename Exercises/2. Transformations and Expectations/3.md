### 2.3
Suppose $X$ has the geometric pmf $f_X(x) = \frac{1}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^x, \ x = 0, 1, 2, \dots$. Determine the probability distribution of $Y = X/(X + 1)$. Note that here both $X$ and $Y$ are discrete random variables. To specify the probability distribution of $Y$, specify its pmf.
