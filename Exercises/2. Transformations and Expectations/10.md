### 2.10
In Theorem 2.1.10, the probability integral transform was proved, relating the uniform cdf to any continuous cdf. In this exercise, we investigate the relationship between discrete random variables and uniform random variables. Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with cdf $F_X(x)$ and define the random variable $Y = F_X(X)$.

(a) Prove that $Y$ is stochastically greater than a uniform(0,1); that is, if $U \sim$ uniform(0,1), then

$$
P(Y > y) = P(U > y) = 1 - y, \text{ for all } y, 0 < y < 1
$$

$$
P(Y > y) > P(U > y) = 1 - y, \text{ for some } y, 0 < y < 1.
$$

(Recall that *stochastically greater* was defined in Exercise 1.49.)

(b) Equivalently, show that the cdf of $Y$ satisfies $F_Y(y) \leq y$ for all $0 < y < 1$ and define $y_0 = F_X(x_0)$. Show that $P(Y \leq y_0) = y_0$. Now establish the inequality by considering $y = y_0 + \epsilon$. Pictures of the cdfs will help.
