A random right triangle can be constructed in the following manner. Let $X$ be a random angle whose distribution is uniform on $(0, \pi/2)$. For each $X$, construct a triangle as pictured below. Here, $Y = \text{height of the random triangle}$. For a fixed constant $d$, find the distribution of $Y$ and $E[Y]$.
