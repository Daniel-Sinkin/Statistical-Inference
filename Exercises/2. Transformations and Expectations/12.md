# Problem
A random right triangle can be constructed in the following manner. Let $X$ be a random angle whose distribution is uniform on $(0, \pi/2)$. For each $X$, construct a triangle as pictured below. Here, $Y = \text{height of the random triangle}$. For a fixed constant $d$, find the distribution of $Y$ and $E[Y]$.

# Solution
Note that because $X \in(0, \pi/2)$ we have $Y > 0$. The hypotenuse of the triangle has length $\sqrt{d^2 + Y^2}$ and the width is $d$. As such
$$
\cos(X) = \frac{d}{\sqrt{d^2  + Y^2}}
$$
or equivalently
$$
\sqrt{d^2 + Y^2} \cos(X) = d
$$
which can be writen as
$$
Y^2 = d^2 \left( \frac{1}{\cos(x)^2} - 1\right)
$$
which, because $Y > 0$ results in
$$
Y = d \sqrt{\frac{1}{\cos(x)^2} - 1}.
$$
As such
$$
g(x) = d \sqrt{\frac{1}{\cos(x)} - 1}.
$$
The inverse of that (as can be seen from the original equation) is
$$
g^{-1}(y) = \cos^{-1}\left( \frac{d}{\sqrt{d^2 + y^2}} \right).
$$
