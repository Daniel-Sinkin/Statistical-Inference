# Problem
Finish the proof of Theorem 1.1.4. For any events $A$, $B$, and $C$ defined on a sample space $S$, show that:

(a) $A \cup B = B \cup A$ and $A \cap B = B \cap A$ (commutativity)

(b) $A \cup (B \cup C) = (A \cup B) \cup C$ and $A \cap (B \cap C) = (A \cap B) \cap C$ (associativity)

(c) $(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c$ and $(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c$ (DeMorgan's Laws)
