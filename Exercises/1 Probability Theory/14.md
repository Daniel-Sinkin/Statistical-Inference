# Problem
Suppose that a sample space $S$ has $n$ elements. Prove that the number of subsets that can be formed from the elements of $S$ is $2^n$.

# Solution
Basically this problem wants us to show that
$$
\left| 2^S \right| = 2^{|S|}
$$
where $2^S$ denotes the powerset, defined by
$$
2^S = \{A : A \subseteq S\}.
$$

Obviously if $n = 1$ then we can write $S = {s}$ and then $2^S = {\emptyset, {s}}$, so the statement holds.

Suppose the statement holds for $k \in \N$, we will show that it then holds for $n = k + 1$ as well. Let $|S| = k + 1$ then we can write
$$
S = S' \cup {s}
$$
where $|S'| = k$ and $s \notin S'$. We know that $\left|2^{S'}\right| = 2^k$, so it suffices to show that
$$
\left|2^{S' \cup \{s\}}\right| = 2 \cdot \left|2^{S'}\right|.
$$

Let $A \in 2^{S}$ then either $A \in 2^{S'}$ or $s \in A$. Suppose $s \in A$ then we can write $A = A' \cup \{s\}$ and $A' \in 2^{S'}$. As such either $A = A' \in 2^{S'}$ or $A = A' \cup \{s\}$ with $A' \in 2^{S'}$. This means that for every set $A$ in $2^{S'}$ there are exactly 2 sets in $2^{S}$, i.e.
$$
\left|2^{S}\right| = 2 \left| 2^{S'}\right|.
$$

The statement then follows by induction.
