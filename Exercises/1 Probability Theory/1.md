(c) Measure the lifetime (in hours) of a particular brand of light bulb.

(d) Record the weights of 10-day-old rats.

(e) Observe the proportion of defectives in a shipment of electronic components.

# Solution
## (a)
$$
\Omega = \{1, 2, \dots, 6\}^4
$$
## (b)
$$
\Omega = \mathbb{N}_0
$$
## (c)
$$
\Omega = [0, \infty)
$$
## (d)
$$
\Omega = (0, \infty)
$$
## (e)
$$
\Omega = \left\{\frac{i}{n} \in \mathbb{R} : 0 \leq i \leq n \right\}
$$
