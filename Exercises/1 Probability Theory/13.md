# Problem
If $P(A) = 1 / 3$ and $P(B^c) = 1/4$, can $A$ and $B$ be disjoint? Explain.

# Solution
No, suppose $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, then $P(A \cap B) = 0$, but by Bonferroni we know that
$$
0 = P(A \cap B) \geq \underbrace{P(A)}_{= 1/3} + \underbrace{P(B) - 1}_{= - P(B^c) = - 1/4} > 0
$$
which is a contradiction.
