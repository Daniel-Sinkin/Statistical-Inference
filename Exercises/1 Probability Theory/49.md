# Problem
A cdf $F_X$ is stochastically greater than a cdf $F_Y$ if $F_X(t) \leq F_Y(t)$ for all $t$ and $F_X(t) < F_Y(t)$ for some $t$. Prove that if $X \sim F_X$ and $Y \sim F_Y$, then

$$P(X > t) \geq P(Y > t) \text{ for every } t$$

and

$$P(X > t) > P(Y > t) \text{ for some } t,$$

that is, $X$ tends to be bigger than $Y$.
