# Problem
Suppose that 5% of men and 0.25% of women are color-blind. A person is chosen at random and that person is color-blind. What is the probability that the person is male? (Assume males and females to be in equal numbers.)

# Solution
Let $m$ denote male, $f$ denote female and $c$ being colorblind. We know the values
$$
p(m) = p(f) = 1/2, p(c|m) = 0.05, p(c|f) = 0.0025,
$$
using the law of total probability we obtain
$$
\begin{aligned}
p(c) &= p(c|m) p(m) + p(c|f) p(f) \\
&= 0.05 \cdot 0.5 + 0.0025 \cdot 0.5 \\
&= 0.0525 \cdot 0.5 \\
&= 0.02625 = 2.625\%.
\end{aligned}
$$
Using Bayes' rule we can compute
$$
\begin{aligned}
p(m | c) &= \frac{p(c | m)p(m)}{p(c)} \\
&= \frac{0.025}{0.02625} \\
&= \frac{2500}{2625} \\
&= \frac{20}{21} \approx 95.24\%.
\end{aligned}
$$
