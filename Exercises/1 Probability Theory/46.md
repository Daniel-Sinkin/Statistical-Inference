# Problem
Seven balls are distributed randomly into seven cells. Let $X_i$ be the number of cells containing exactly $i$ balls. What is the probability distribution of $X_3$? (That is, find $P(X_3 = x)$ for every possible $x$.)

# Solution
First of all note that $0 \leq X_3 \leq 2$ as there can't be $3$ or more cells with $3$ balls, because that would already require 9 balls.

To compute $P(X_3 = 2)$ we first note that means that there are $2$ cells with 3 balls and $1$ cells with 1 ball. There are $\binom{7}{2}$ ways to distribute the cells with $3$ elements, and then the $1$ ball can be in any of the remaining $5$ cells, with a total of $\binom{5}{1}$ combinations.

We can arbitrarily permute the $6$ balls in the $3$ element cells, meaning we get $6!$ permutations that way.

The total number of ways to distribute $7$ balls to $7$ cells is $7^7$.

As such
$$
P(X_3 = 2) = \frac{\binom{7}{2} \cdot 6! \cdot \binom{5}{1}}{7^7}
$$
