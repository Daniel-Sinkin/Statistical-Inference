# Problem
If $n$ balls are placed at random into $n$ cells, find the probability that exactly one cell remains empty.

# Solution
The main observation for this problem is that because we have $n$ balls and $n$ cells, if one is empty, then we have $n$ balls over $n - 1$ cells, because exactly one cell is empty this means that all other cells have to contain at least one ball. In particular this means that we have $1$ cell with no ball, $n - 2$ cells with 1 ball and $1$ cell with 2 balls.

The total number of ways to put n balls into n cells if $n^n$ and the number of choices for the 2-ball and empty cell is $\binom{n}{2}$. Because the balls are indistinguishable we can, for every assignment permute the balls freely, as there are $n$ balls we get $n!$ permutations, so the total number of possible arrangements with $1$ empty cell, $n - 2$ cells with 1 ball and $1$ cell with 2 balls is $\binom{n}{2} \cdot n!$ so the probability is
$$
\frac{\binom{n}{2} n!}{n^n}.
