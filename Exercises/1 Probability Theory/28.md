# Problem
A way of approximating large factorials is through the use of Stirling's Formula:

$$
n! \approx \sqrt{2\pi n} \, n^{n+\frac{1}{2}} e^{-n}
$$

a complete derivation of which is difficult. Instead, prove the easier fact,

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n!}{n^{n+(1/2)}e^{-n}} = \text{a constant}.
$$

*Hint:* Feller 1968 proceeds by using the monotonicity of the logarithm to establish that

$$
\int_{k-1}^{k} \log x \, dx < \log k < \int_{k}^{k+1} \log x \, dx, \quad k = 1, \dots, n,
$$

and hence

$$
\int_{0}^{n} \log x \, dx < \log n! < \int_{1}^{n+1} \log x \, dx.
$$

Now compare $\log n!$ to the average of the two integrals. See Exercise 5.35 for another derivation.
