The inclusion-exclusion identity of Miscellanea 1.8.1 gets its name from the fact that it is proved by the method of inclusion and exclusion (Feller 1968, Section IV.1). Here we go into the details. The probability $P(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i)$ is the sum of the probabilities of all the sample points that are contained in at least one of the $A_i$s. The method of inclusion and exclusion is a recipe for counting these points.

(a) Let $E_k$ denote the set of all sample points that are contained in exactly $k$ of the events $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$. Show that $P(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(E_i)$.

(b) Without loss of generality, assume that $E_k$ is contained in $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_k$. Show that $P(E_k)$ appears $k$ times in the sum $P_1$, ${k \choose 2}$ times in the sum $P_2$, $\dots$, ${k \choose k}$ times in the sum $P_k$, etc.

(c) Show that

$$
k - {k \choose 2} + {k \choose 3} - \dots + (-1)^{k-1}{k \choose k} = 1.
$$

(d) Show that parts (a) - (c) imply

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(E_i) = P_1 - P_2 + P_3 - \dots \pm P_n,
$$

establishing the inclusion-exclusion identity.
