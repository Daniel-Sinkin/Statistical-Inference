# Problem
Two pennies, one with $P(\text{head}) = u$ and one with $P(\text{head}) = w$, are to be tossed together independently. Define:

- $p_0 = P(0 \text{ heads occur})$
- $p_1 = P(1 \text{ head occurs})$
- $p_2 = P(2 \text{ heads occur})$

Can $u$ and $w$ be chosen such that $p_0 = p_1 = p_2$? Prove your answer.
