# Problem
If a multivariate function has continuous partial derivatives, the order in which teh derivates are calcualted does not mattrer. Thus, for example, the function $f(x, y)$ of two variables has equal thrid partials
$$
\frac{\partial^3}{\partial x^2 \partial y} f(x, y) = \frac{\partial^3}{\partial x \partial x^2} f(x, y)
$$

(a) How many fourth partial derivatives does a function of three variables have?

(b) Prove that a function of $n$ variables has
$$
\binom{n + r - 1}{r}
$$
$r$th partial derivates.

# Solution
This problem asks how many times we can partition 4 as a non-negative sum of 3 integers, i.e. the cardinality of the multiindex set
$$
M(3, 4) := \left\{(x_i)_{1 \leq i \leq 3} \in \Z_{\geq 0}^3 : \sum­_{i = 1}^3 x_i = 4\right\}
$$
or more generally of
$$
M(n, r) := \left\{(x_i)_{1 \leq i \leq n} \in \Z_{\geq 0}^3 : \sum­_{i = 1}^n x_i = r\right\}
$$
where $n$ is the number of variables and r is the order of the derivative.

(a)
We can explicitly write out
$$
\begin{aligned}
M(3, 4) = \{&\\
&&(4, 0, 0), (3, 0, 1), (3, 1, 0), \\
&&(2, 0, 2), (2, 1, 1), (2, 2, 0), \\
&&(1, 0, 3), (1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 1), \\
&&(1, 3, 0), (0, 0, 4), (0, 1, 3), \\
&&(0, 2, 2), (0, 3, 1), (0, 4, 0) \\
&\}
\end{aligned}
$$
noting that $|M(3, 4)| = 15 = \binom{3 + 4 - 1}{4}$ and that if we fix any coordinate to have value $x$ then there are $|M(3 - 1, 4 - x)|$ that satisfy that constraint.

(b)
Using the last observation we can see that
$$
|M(n, r)| = \sum_{i = 0}^r |M(n - 1, r - i)|.
$$

Note that
$$
\binom{n + r}{r} = \frac{(n + r)!}{n! r!}
$$
and
$$
\begin{aligned}
\binom{(n + 1) + r}{r} &= \frac{(n + 1 + r)!}{(n + 1)! r!} \\
&= \frac{n + 1 + r}{n+1} \frac{(n + r)!}{n! r!} \\
&= \frac{n + 1 + r}{n + 1} \binom{n + r}{r}
\end{aligned}
$$

Okay now fix $M(n, r)$ and suppose that we increase $n$ by one, i.e. add a new variable, then we we have all the derivates where that new variable is not differentiated and we can take any number away from the other derivates to differentiate the new variable.
