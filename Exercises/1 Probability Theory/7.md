# Problem
Refer to the dart game of Example 1.2.7. Suppose we do not assume that the probability of hitting the dart board is 1, but rather is proportional to the area of the dart board. Assume that the dart board is mounted on a wall that is hit with probability 1, and the wall has area $A$.

(a) Using the fact that the probability of hitting a region is proportional to area, construct a probability function for $$ P(\text{scoring } i \text{ points}) $$, $$ i = 0, \dots, 5 $$. (No points are scored if the dart board is not hit.)

(b) Show that the conditional probability distribution $$ P(\text{scoring } i \text{ points | board is hit}) $$ is exactly the probability distribution of Example 1.2.7.

# Solution
## (a)
The probability is proportionaly to the area. Let $W \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ be the wall and $\lambda^2$ be the area (2-dim Lebesgue measure) then we know that
$$
\lambda^2(W) = A
$$
and for the dartboard with radius r and center $c \in W$ we have
$$
B_r(c) := {x \in \mathbb{R}^2 : ||x - c|| \leq r}.
$$
We assume that $B_r(c) \subseteq W$ and write $D := B_r(c)$. It is well known that
$$
\lambda^2(D) = \pi r^2.
$$
The probability of hitting the dard board is
$$
\frac{\lambda^2(D)}{\lambda^2(W)} = \frac{\pi r^2}{W}
$$

Let $S \subseteq D$ be a measureable subset then we know that
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(S | D) &= \frac{P(S \cap D)}{P(D)} \\
&\overset{*}{=} \frac{P(S)}{P(D)}
\end{aligned}
$$
where we have used that $S \subseteq D \implies S \cap D = S$ in $*$. Note that this is precisely the probability of hitting S if our total domain is $D$, which is the situation of Example 1.2.7.

This also solves (b) and the computation for (a) just reduces down to noticing that we have to divide numberator and denominator by $A$ (which cancels) to get the probability relative to the wall.
