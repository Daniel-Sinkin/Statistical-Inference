# Problem
If the probability of hitting a target is $\frac{1}{5}$, and ten shots are fired independently, what is the probability of the target being hit at least twice? What is the conditional probability that the target is hit at least twice, given that it is hit at least once?

# Solution
$p = 0.2$, let $X$ := #hits, then of course $0 \leq X \leq 10$. We are interested in $P(X \geq 2) = 1 - P(X \leq 1)$.

This can be computed explicitly by noting that $X \sim \operatorname{Bin}(10, 0.2)$, so it has the pmf
$$
P(X = i) = \binom{10}{i} 0.2^i \cdot 0.8^{10 - i}
$$
Plugging in $i = 0$ and $i = 1$ yields
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(X \geq 2) &= 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1) \\
&= 1 - 0.8^{10} - 10 \cdot 0.2 \cdot 0.8^9 \approx 62.42\%.
\end{aligned}
$$

We now want to compute the quantity
$$
P(X \geq 2 | X \geq 1) = \frac{P(X \geq 2, X \geq 1)}{P(X \geq 1)}.
$$
Because $X \geq 2 \implies X \geq 1$ we have $P(X \geq 2, X \geq 1) = P(X \geq 2)$ and so this becomes
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1)}{1 - P(X = 0)} &= 1 - \frac{P(X = 1)}{1 - P(X = 0)} \\
&= 1 - \frac{10 \cdot 0.2 \cdot 0.8^9}{1 - 0.8^{10}} \approx 69.93\%.
\end{aligned}
