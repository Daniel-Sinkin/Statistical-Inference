# Problem
Approximately one-third of all human twins are identical (one-egg) and two-thirds are fraternal (two-egg) twins. Identical twins are necessarily the same sex, with male and female being equally likely. Among fraternal twins, approximately one-fourth are both female, one-fourth are both male, and half are one male and one female. Finally, among all U.S. births, approximately 1 in 90 is a twin birth. Define the following events:

- $A = \{$a U.S. birth results in twin females$\}$
- $B = \{$a U.S. birth results in identical twins$\}$
- $C = \{$a U.S. birth results in twins$\}$

(a) State, in words, the event $A \cap B \cap C$.

(b) Find $P(A \cap B \cap C)$.
