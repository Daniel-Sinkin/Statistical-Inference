# Problem
Standardized tests provide an interesting application of probability theory. Suppose first that a test consists of 20 multiple-choice questions, each with 4 possible answers. If the student guesses on each question, then the taking of the exam can be modeled as a sequence of 20 independent events. Find the probability that the student gets at least 10 questions correct, given that he is guessing.

# Solution
$$dG
P(X = i) = \binom{20}{i} (1/4)^{i}(3/4)^{20 - i} 
$$

We are interested in finding
$$
P(X \geq 10) = 1 - P(X \leq 9) = 1 - \sumÂ­_{i = 0}^9 P(X = i).
$$

Note that
$$
\sum_{i = 0}^9 P(X = i) = \sum_{i = 0}^9 \binom{20}{i}(1/4)^{i} (3 / 4)^{20 - i} 
$$

Computing this yields
$$
P(X \geq 10) \approx 1.39%.
$$
