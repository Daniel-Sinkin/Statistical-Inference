# Problem
Standardized tests provide an interesting application of probability theory. Suppose first that a test consists of 20 multiple-choice questions, each with 4 possible answers. If the student guesses on each question, then the taking of the exam can be modeled as a sequence of 20 independent events. Find the probability that the student gets at least 10 questions correct, given that he is guessing.
