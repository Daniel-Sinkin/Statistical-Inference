Derive the inclusion-exclusion identity of Miscellanea 1.8.1:

(a) Derive both Boole's and Bonferroni's Inequality from the inclusion-exclusion identity.

(b) Show that the $P_i$ satisfy $P_i \geq P_j$ if $i \leq j$ and that the sequence of bounds in Miscellanea 1.8.1 improves as the number of terms increases.

(c) Typically, as the number of terms in the bound increases, the bound becomes more useful. However, Schwager (1984) cautions that there are some cases where the bound is not much improvement, in particular if the $A_i$s are highly correlated. Examine what happens to the sequence of bounds in the extreme case when $A_i = A$ for every $i$.
