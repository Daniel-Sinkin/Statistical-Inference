# Problem
As in Example 1.3.6, consider telegraph signals "dot" and "dash" sent in the proportion 3:4, where erratic transmissions cause a dot to become a dash with probability $\frac{1}{4}$ and a dash to become a dot with probability $\frac{1}{3}$.

(a) If a dash is received, what is the probability that a dash has been sent?

(b) Assuming independence between signals, if the message dotâ€“dot was received, what is the probability distribution of the four possible messages that could have been sent?
