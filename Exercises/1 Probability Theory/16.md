# Problem
How many different sets of initials can be formed if every person ahs one surname and
(a) exactly two given names?
(b) eitehr one or two given names?
(c) either one or two or three given names?

# Solution
## (a)
There are 26 letters in the alphabet so for every name one initial, meaning we get $26^3$

## (b)
The two cases are disjoint so we can just add their numbers giving $26^2 + 26^3$.

## (c)
Same as (b), we get $26^2 + 26^3 + 26^4$.
