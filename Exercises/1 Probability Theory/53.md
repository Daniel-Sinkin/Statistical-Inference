# Problem
A certain river floods every year. Suppose that the low-water mark $Y$ has distribution function

$$F_Y(y) = P(Y \leq y) = 1 - \frac{1}{y^2}, \; 1 \leq y < \infty.$$

(a) Verify that $F_Y(y)$ is a cdf.

(b) Find $f_Y(y)$, the pdf of $Y$.

(c) If the low-water mark is reset at 0 and we use a unit of measurement that is $\frac{1}{10}$ of that given previously, the high-water mark becomes $Z = 10(Y - 1)$. Find $F_Z(z)$.
