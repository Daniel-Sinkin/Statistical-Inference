## Theorem 1.5.3
The function $F(x)$ is a cdf if and only if the following three conditions hold:
1. $\lim_{x \rightarrow -\infty} F(x) = 0$ and $\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} F(x) = 1$.
2. $F(x)$ is a nondecreasing function of $x$.
3. $F(x)$ is right-continuous; that is, for every number $x_0$, $\lim_{x \downarrow x_0} F(x) = F(x_0)$

**Outline of Proof:** To prove necessity, the three properties can be verified by writing $F$ in terms of the probability function (see Exercise 1.48).

# Solution
Let $(x_n)_n$ be a monotone decreasing sequence with $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} x_n = -\infty$ then
$$
A_n := \{x : X(x) \leq x_n\}
$$
satisfies $A_{n + 1} \subseteq A_n$ and by Kolmogorov's axioms if $A_n \downarrow \emptyset$ then $P(A_n) \rightarrow 0$. This is the case for our sequence (and more generally for sublevel sets of continuous functions) as such
$$
\lim_{x \rightarrow -\infty} F(x) = 0.
$$

For the other direction consider a sequence that goes to $+\infty$ and consider the complement of the sublevelsets (I guess the super levelsets?) those are also vanishing as we can write $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A).$ As such
$$
\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} F(x) = +1.
$$

Non-decreasing follows from the fact that if $x > x'$ then $(-\infty, x'] \subseteq (-\infty, x]$ and therefore 
$$
X^{-1}((-\infty, x']) \subseteq X^{-1}((-\infty, x])
$$
and because $P$ is non-negative we have
$$
F(x)= P(X^{-1}((-\infty, x])) = P(X \leq x) = P(X \leq x') + P(x' < X \leq x) \geq P(X \leq x') = F(x').
$$

This can be proved the same way the $\lim_{x \rightarrow -\infty}F(x) = 0$ case was proved just with the sequence converging to $x_0$ instead of $-\infty$.
