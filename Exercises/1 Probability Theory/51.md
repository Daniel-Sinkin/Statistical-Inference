# Problem
An appliance store receives a shipment of 30 microwave ovens, 5 of which are (unknown to the manager) defective. The store manager selects 4 ovens at random, without replacement, and tests to see if they are defective. Let $X$ = number of defectives found. Calculate the pmf and cdf of $X$ and plot the cdf.
