# Problem
### Exercise 1.37

(a) In the warden's calculation of Example 1.3.4 it was assumed that if A were to be pardoned, then with equal probability the warden would tell A that either B or C would die. However, this need not be the case. The warden can assign probabilities $\gamma$ and $1 - \gamma$ to these events, as shown here:

| Prisoner pardoned | Warden tells A | Probability          |
|-------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| A                 | B dies         | with probability $\gamma$  |
| A                 | C dies         | with probability $1 - \gamma$  |
| B                 | B dies         |                       |
| C                 | B dies         |                       |

Calculate $P(A|W)$ as a function of $\gamma$. For what values of $\gamma$ is $P(A|W)$ less than, equal to, or greater than $\frac{1}{3}$?

(b) Suppose again that $\gamma = \frac{1}{2}$, as in the example. After the warden tells A that B will die, A thinks for a while and realizes that his original calculation was false. However, A then gets a bright idea. A asks the warden if he can swap fates with C. The warden, thinking that no information has been passed, agrees to this. Prove that Aâ€™s reasoning is now correct and that his probability of survival has jumped to $\frac{2}{3}$.
