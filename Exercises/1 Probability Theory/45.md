# Problem
Show that the induced probability function defined in (1.4.1) defines a legitimate probability function in that it satisfies the Kolmogorov Axioms.

# Solution
Let $X : S \rightarrow \mathcal{X}$ be a random variable where $S = \{s_1, \dots, s_n\}$ and $\mathcal{X} = \{x_1, \dots, x_n\}$, then we define the induced probability function for $x_j \in \mathcal{X}$
$$
P_X(X = x_j) = P(\{s \in S : X(s) = x_j\}).
$$

Obviously $P \geq 0$ implies $P_X \geq 0$ and 
$$
\begin{aligned}
P_X(\mathcal{X}) &= P(\{s \in S : X(s) \in \mathcal{X}\}) \\
&= P(s \in S) = 1
\end{aligned}
$$
where the last step holds because $P$ is a probability function.

For the last axiom, because $\mathcal{X}$ is finite we only have to check finite sequences. Let $A_1, \dots A_k \subseteq \mathcal{X}$ be disjoint then
$$
\begin{aligned}
P_X\left(\bigcup_{i = 1}^k A_i\right) &= P\left(\left\{s \in S : X(s) \in \bigcup_{i = 1}^k A_i \right\}\right) \\
&= \sum_{i = 1}^k P(\{s \in S : X(s) \in A_i\}) \\
&= \sum_{i = 1}^k P(X \in A_i).
\end{aligned}
$$

As such $P_X$ satisfies all of the Kolmogov axioms and is therefore a probability function.
