# Problem
The Smiths have two children. At least one of them is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys? (See Gardner 1961 for a complete discussion of this problem.)

# Solution
We want to compute $P(\operatorname{boy}, \operatorname{boy} | \text{at least one boy})$, which is the same as
$$
\frac{P(\operatorname{boy}, \operatorname{boy} \cap \text{ at least one boy})}{P(\text{at least one boy})}
$$
obviously $\operatorname{boy}, \operatorname{boy} \cap \text{ at least one boy} = \operatorname{boy}, \operatorname{boy}$ so we just have to compute
$$
\frac{P(\operatorname{boy}, \operatorname{boy})}{P(\text{at least one boy})}.
$$

Note that
$$
P(\operatorname{boy}, \operatorname{boy}) = P(\operatorname{boy}) P(\operatorname{boy})
$$
because the gender of the second and first child are independent events, and because $P(\operatorname{boy}) = 1/2$ we get
$$
P(\operatorname{boy}, \operatorname{boy}) = \frac{1}{4}.
$$

Furthermore
$$
P(\text{at least one boy}) = 1 - P(\operatorname{girl}, \operatorname{girl}) = 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
$$
by similiar reasoning.

In total we get
$$
\frac{P(\operatorname{boy}, \operatorname{boy})}{P(\text{at least one boy})} = \frac{1/4}{3/4} = \frac{1}{3}.
$$
