# Problem
(a) Derive the general formula for the probability of scoring $i$ points.

(b) Show that $$ P(\text{scoring } i \text{ points}) $$ is a decreasing function of $i$, that is, as the points increase, the probability of scoring them decreases.

(c) Show that $$ P(\text{scoring } i \text{ points}) $$ is a probability function according to the Kolmogorov Axioms.

# Solution
## (a)
Suppose we have n rings and radius $r$ then we get
$$
r_i = i \cdot \frac{r}{n}, r_0 := 0
$$
for the ith radius, in particular $r_{i + 1} - r_{i} = \frac{r}{n}$ is independent of $i$.

Denote by $S_i$ the $ith$ strip then
$$
S_i = B_{r_i} \backslash B_{r_{i - 1}}
$$
(note that we can disregard boundary because boundaries are zero-measure sets) and so the volume of $S_i$ is
$$
\lambda^2(S_i) = \lambda^2(B_{r_i}) - \lambda^2(B_{r_{i - 1}}) = \pi r_i^2 - \pi r_{i - 1}^2
$$
The probability of hitting then is given by
$$
\frac{\pi (r_i^2 - r_{i - 1}^2)}{\pi r^2}
$$
because $r_{i} = r_{i - 1} + \frac{r}{n}$ we get
$$
\begin{aligned}
r_i^2 - r_{i - 1}^2 &= i^2 \frac{r^2}{n^2} - (i - 1)^2 \frac{r^2}{n^2} \\
&= \left(i^2 - (i - 1)^2\right) \frac{r^2}{n^2}.
\end{aligned}
$$
Putting everything together, the probability of hitting the $i$th strip is
$$
\frac{i^2 - (i - 1)^2}{n^2}.
$$

## (b)
Let
$$
f(x) := x^2 - (x - 1)^2
$$
and note that if $f$ is a decreasing function (for $x \in (0, 1)$) then so is $P(\text{scoring } i\text{ points})$ because $i / n \in [0, 1)$

As a polynomial $f$ is differentiable everywhere and it is easy to see that
$$
f'(x) = 2x - 2(x-1) = -2 < 0,
$$
as such $f$ is (strictly) monotone decreasing.

## (c)
Recall that $P(\text{scoring } i \text{ points}) = P(S_i)$.

The additvity for pairwaise disjointness follows directly from construction. 

Obviously $\cup_i S_i = D$ is a partition of $D$ by construction so
$$
P(D) = P(\cup_i S_i) = \sum_i P(S_i) = 1.
$$

Furthermore it's obvious that $P(S_i) \geq 0$.
