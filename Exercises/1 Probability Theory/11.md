# Problem
Let $S$ be a sample space.

(a) Show that the collection $\mathcal{B} = \{ \varnothing, S \}$ is a sigma algebra.

(b) Let $\mathcal{B} = \{$all subsets of $S$, including $S$ itself$\}$. Show that $\mathcal{B}$ is a sigma algebra.

(c) Show that the intersection of two sigma algebras is a sigma algebra.
