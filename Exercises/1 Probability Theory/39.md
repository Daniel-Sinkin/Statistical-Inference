# Problem
A pair of events $A$ and $B$ cannot be simultaneously *mutually exclusive* and *independent*. Prove that if $P(A) > 0$ and $P(B) > 0$, then:

(a) If $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive, they cannot be independent.

(b) If $A$ and $B$ are independent, they cannot be mutually exclusive.

# Solution
## (a)
If they are mutually exclusive then $P(A \cap B) = 0$ but
$$
P(A) P(B) > 0 \implies P(A)P(B) \neq P(A \cap B)
$$
so they are not independent.

## (b)
Same as (a).
