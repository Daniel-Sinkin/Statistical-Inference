# Problem
Prove that the following functions are cdfs:

(a) $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{\pi} \tan^{-1}(x)$, $x \in (-\infty, \infty)$

(b) $\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$, $x \in (-\infty, \infty)$

(c) $e^{-e^{-x}}$, $x \in (-\infty, \infty)$

(d) $1 - e^{-x}$, $x \in (0, \infty)$

# Solution
This is basically just computation, take the limit to left and right boundary, check that it's $0$ and $1$ respectively.

Then note that all of those are diffeomorphic on their domain, differentiate and note that the derivative is positive.

Those functions being CDFs then directly follows from Theorem 1.5.3 as they are continuous and therefore right-continuous.
