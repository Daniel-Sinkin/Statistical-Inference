# Problem
A fair die is cast until a $6$ appears. What isat he probability that it must be ast more than five times?

# Solution
The Probability that it must be cast more than $5$ times is exactly $1$ minus the probability that we get a $6$ in the first $5$ rolls. This means we want to compute
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\text{more than 5}) =& 1 - P(\text{at most 5}) \\
=& 1 - P(\text{exactly 1}) - P(\text{exactly 2}) \\
&- P(\text{exactly 3}) - P(\text{exactly 4}) \\
&- P(\text{exactly 5})
\end{aligned}
$$
Getting a $6$ in exactly $i$ throws means that we didn't get it the first $i - 1$ times and got it the $i$th time, which has a probability of
$$
P(\text{exactly i})\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{i - 1}\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)
$$

Plugging this into the equation from before we get
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\text{more than 5}) =& 1 - \frac{1}{6} - \frac{5}{6} \frac{1}{6} \\
&- \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 \frac{1}{6} - \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3 \frac{1}{6} \\
&- \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 \frac{1}{6} - \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^5 \frac{1}{6} - 
\end{aligned}
$$
This can be written as a sum
$$
1 - \frac{1}{6}\sum_{i = 0}^5 \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^i
$$
applying the geometric sum to this yields
$$
1 - \frac{1}{6} \frac{1 - \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^6}{1 - \frac{5}{6}} = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^6 \approx 33.49\%.
