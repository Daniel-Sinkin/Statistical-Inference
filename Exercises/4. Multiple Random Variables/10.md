# Problem
The random pair (X, Y) has the distribution

|   |       |      |   X   |      |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|
|   |       |   1  |   2   |   3  |
|   | **2** | 1/12 | 1/6   | 1/12 |
| Y | **3** | 1/6  | 0     | 1/6  |
|   | **4** | 0    | 1/3   | 0    |

1. Show that $X$ and $Y$ are dependent
2. Give a probability table for random variables U and V that has the same marginals as $X$ and $Y$ but are independent.

# Solution
## (a)
We can compute the following marginal probabilities 
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(X = 1) &= P(X = 1, Y = 2) + P(X = 1, Y = 3) + P(X = 1, Y = 4) = 1/12 + 1/6 + 0 = 1/4 \\
P(Y = 3) &= P(X = 1, Y = 3) + P(X = 2, Y = 3) + P(X = 3, Y = 3) = 1/6 + 0 + 1/6 = 1/3
\end{aligned}
$$
but then
$$
P(X=1, Y = 3) = 1/6 \neq 1/12 = 1/4 \cdot 1/3 = P(X = 1)P(Y = 3).
$$

## (b)
Would just compute all possible combinations $P(X = i, Y = j)$ and write them into the table.
