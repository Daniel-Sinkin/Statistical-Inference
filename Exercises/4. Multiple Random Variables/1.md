# Problem
A random point $(X, Y)$ is distributed uniformly on teh square with vertices $(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)$. That is, the joint pdf if $f(x, y) = 1/4$ on the square. Determine teh probabilities of the following events.
1. $X^2 + Y^2 < 1$
2. $2X - Y > 0$
3. $|X + Y| < 2$

# Solution
## (a)
Note that $X^2 + Y^2 < 1$ if and only if $Y^2 < 1 - X^2$ as such we can compute
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(X^2 + Y^2 < 1) &= P(Y^2 < 1 - X^2) \\
&= \int_{-1}^1 P(Y^2 < 1 - x^2) dx \\
&= \int_{-1}^1 \int_{-\sqrt{1 - x^2}}^{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} f(x, y) dy dx \\
&= \frac{1}{2}\int_{-1}^1 2\sqrt{1 - x^2} dx \\
&= \int_{-1}^1 \sqrt{1 - x^2} dx = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\end{aligned}
$$

## (b)
$2X - Y > 0 \iff Y < 2X$ as such
$$
P(2X - Y > 0) = P(Y < 2X) = \int_{-1}^1 P(Y < 2x) dx = \int_{-1}^1 \int_{-1}^{2x} f(x, y) dy dx = \frac{1}{4}\int_{-1}^1 (2x + 1) dx = \frac{1}{2}.
$$

## (c)
Note that $|X + Y| \leq |X| + |Y| \leq 2$ as such every point that is not $|X + Y| = 2$ in the square satisfies this equation, because that latter equation only holds for a finite set (the corners) it has measure zero. As such $P(|X + Y| < 2) = 1$.
