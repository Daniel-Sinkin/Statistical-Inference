# Problem
Given that $g(x) \geq 0$ has the property that
$$
\int_0^\infty g(x) dx = 1,
$$
show that
$$
f(x, y) = \frac{2g\left(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\right)}{\pi \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}
$$
for $x, y > 0$ is a pdf.

# Solution
We apply the polar coordinate transformation $\phi(r, \alpha) = (r \cos(\alpha), r \sin(\alpha)) = (x, y)$, recalling that
$$
x^2 + y^2 = r^2
$$
and that the Jacobian determinant is equal to $r$. Furthermore, for the upper right quadrant we have the restrictions $0 \leq r, 0 \leq \alpha < \pi / 2$, with that we can compute
$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_0^\infty \int_0^\infty f(x, y) dx dy &= \iint_{\phi^{-1}([0, \infty) \times [0, \infty))} f(\phi(r, \alpha)) dx(r, \alpha) dy(r, \alpha) \\
&= \int_0^\infty \int_0^{\pi/2} f(\phi(r, \alpha)) |\det D\phi(r, \alpha)| d\alpha dr.
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = r$ as such
$$
\tilde{f}(r, \alpha) := f(\phi(r, \alpha)) = \frac{2g(r)}{\pi r}.
$$

The Jacobian determinant is just the rotation matrix with angle $\alpha$ scaled with $r$, as such its determinant is equal to $r$. 

With that we can compute the integral:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_0^\infty \int_0^{\pi/2} f(\phi(r, \alpha)) |\det D\phi(r, \alpha)| dr d\alpha &= \int_0^\infty \int_0^{\pi / 2} \frac{2g(r)}{r\pi} r d\alpha dr \\
&= \int_0^\infty \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{2g(r)}{r\pi} r dr \\
&= \int_0^\infty g(r) dr = 1.
\end{aligned}
$$
