# Theorem 4.2.12
Let $X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ and $Y \sim \mathcal{N}(\gamma, \tau^2)$ be independent normal random variables. Then the random variable $Z = X + Y$ has a $\mathcal{N}(\mu + \gamma, \sigma^2 + \tau^2)$ distribution. 

## Proof Sketch
This follows immediately from Theorem 4.2.12 and Exercise 2.33 .
