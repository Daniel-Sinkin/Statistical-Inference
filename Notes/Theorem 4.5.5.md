# Theorem 4.5.5
If $X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables, then $\operatorname{Cov}(X, Y) = 0$ and $\rho_{XY} = 0$.

## Proof Sketch
Using Theorem 4.2.10 we have $E[XY] = E[X] \cdot E[Y]$. Expanding covariance equation shows that its zero, $\rho_{XY}$ is just a scalar multiple of the covariance an therefore also zero.
